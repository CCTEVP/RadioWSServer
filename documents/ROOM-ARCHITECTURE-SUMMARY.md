# Room-Based Router Architecture - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What Was Built

I've successfully transformed your WebSocket server into a **modular, room-based architecture** where each room can have its own folder with specific functionality while inheriting base capabilities from the server.

## 📁 New Structure

```
src/
├── server.js                          # Main server (now delegates to room handlers)
├── rooms/
    ├── BaseRoomHandler.js             # Abstract base class - all rooms inherit from this
    ├── index.js                       # Room registry - auto-discovers handlers
    ├── radioContent/
    │   └── index.js                   # Your radio content room with specific logic
    └── chat/
        └── index.js                   # Example chat room (demonstrates features)
```

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Room Discovery**

- Just create a folder `src/rooms/yourRoom/` with an `index.js`
- The server automatically finds and loads it on startup
- No need to manually register rooms!

### 2. **Inheritance Model**

- All rooms extend `BaseRoomHandler`
- Override only the methods you need
- Common functionality is inherited automatically

### 3. **Room-Specific Logic**

Each room handler can customize:

- ✅ Message validation
- ✅ Message processing/transformation
- ✅ HTTP POST validation and processing
- ✅ Welcome messages
- ✅ Connection acceptance/rejection
- ✅ Statistics and health info
- ✅ Periodic maintenance tasks

## 📝 Created Rooms

### **radioContent** (Production Room)

Located in: `src/rooms/radioContent/index.js`

Features:

- ✅ Content history tracking (last 10 items)
- ✅ Content validation (requires content ID)
- ✅ Custom welcome message with recent content
- ✅ Enhanced statistics (content count, last update)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of old content
- ✅ Tracks client connection duration and message count

### **chat** (Example Room)

Located in: `src/rooms/chat/index.js`

Features:

- ✅ Username management (required before chatting)
- ✅ Message filtering (banned words)
- ✅ User list tracking
- ✅ Typing indicators
- ✅ System messages (user joined/left)
- ✅ Message history counter
- ✅ Maximum message length validation

## 🛠️ How to Create a New Room

### Quick Start (3 Steps):

1. **Create folder:**

   ```bash
   mkdir src/rooms/myNewRoom
   ```

2. **Create handler file** (`src/rooms/myNewRoom/index.js`):

   ```javascript
   import { BaseRoomHandler } from "../BaseRoomHandler.js";

   export class MyNewRoomHandler extends BaseRoomHandler {
     constructor() {
       super("myNewRoom");
       // Your initialization here
     }

     // Override methods as needed
     async onMessage(payload, socket, clientAddress) {
       // Your custom logic
       return payload; // or modified payload
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   You'll see: `✓ Registered handler for room: myNewRoom`

### That's it! 🎊

- All available methods to override
- Real-world examples
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide
- Advanced patterns

## 🧪 Testing

### Server is Running ✅

```
Initializing room handlers...
✓ Registered handler for room: radioContent
✓ Registered handler for room: chat
Registered 2 room handler(s): [ 'radioContent', 'chat' ]
Room handlers ready: radioContent, chat
```

### Test with Browser

1. Open `test-client.html` in your browser
2. Connect to different rooms:
   - `ws://localhost:8080/radioContent`
   - `ws://localhost:8080/chat`
3. See custom welcome messages and room-specific behavior!

### Test with curl

**Check health (shows room handlers):**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Post to radioContent room:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/postcontent/radioContent \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type":"update",
    "timestamp":"2025-10-14T00:00:00Z",
    "data":{
      "content":{"id":123,"name":"Test Content"},
      "advertiser":{"id":1,"name":"Test Ad"}
    }
  }'
```

**Post to chat room:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/postcontent/chat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type":"announcement",
    "timestamp":"2025-10-14T00:00:00Z",
    "data":{"message":"Server announcement"}
  }'
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Connection Flow:

```
Client connects to ws://server/roomName
         ↓
Server extracts room name from URL
         ↓
Room registry provides handler for that room
         ↓
Handler.onJoin() - validates/accepts connection
         ↓
Handler.getWelcomeMessage() - custom greeting
         ↓
Client receives welcome message
```

### Message Flow:

```
Client sends message
         ↓
Handler.validateMessage() - checks if valid
         ↓
Handler.onMessage() - processes/transforms
         ↓
Server broadcasts to room members
```

### HTTP POST Flow:

```
POST /postcontent/roomName
         ↓
Handler.validateHttpPost() - validates payload
         ↓
Handler.onHttpPost() - processes/transforms
         ↓
Broadcast to all clients in that room
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### For You:

1. **Clean separation** - Each room has its own folder
2. **Reusable code** - Common logic in BaseRoomHandler
3. **Easy to extend** - Just create a new folder
4. **Type safety** - Clear method contracts
5. **Testable** - Each handler can be tested independently

### For Your Applications:

1. **Custom behavior per room** - Each app gets exactly what it needs
2. **Backward compatible** - radioContent works as before
3. **Scalable** - Add new rooms without touching existing ones
4. **Maintainable** - Room logic is isolated

## 📊 Architecture Benefits

### Before (Monolithic):

```javascript
// All logic mixed together in server.js
if (roomName === "radioContent") {
  // Radio logic
} else if (roomName === "chat") {
  // Chat logic
} else if (roomName === "game") {
  // Game logic
}
// Hard to maintain, test, extend
```

### After (Modular):

```
src/rooms/radioContent/  ← Radio logic here
src/rooms/chat/          ← Chat logic here
src/rooms/game/          ← Game logic here
src/rooms/yourNew/       ← Your new room logic here
```

Each room is:

- Self-contained
- Independently testable
- Easy to understand
- Simple to modify

## 🔐 Security & Validation

Each room can:

- **Validate connections** - Reject unwanted clients
- **Validate messages** - Check structure, content, permissions
- **Sanitize data** - Clean/transform before broadcasting
- **Rate limiting** - Track and limit per room
- **Custom authentication** - Token validation, API keys, etc.

## 🎨 Customization Examples

### Custom Welcome Messages

radioContent sends recent content history
chat sends user list and instructions

### Custom Validation

radioContent requires content.id
chat requires username and message length

### Custom Processing

radioContent tracks content history
chat adds usernames and timestamps

### Custom Statistics

radioContent shows content count
chat shows user list and message count

## 📖 Next Steps

1. **Explore existing handlers:**

   - Read `src/rooms/radioContent/index.js`
   - Read `src/rooms/chat/index.js`

2. **Read the guide:**

   - Open `ROOM-HANDLER-GUIDE.md`
   - Follow examples
   - Try creating a test room

3. **Create your rooms:**

   - Identify your applications
   - Create handler folders
   - Implement custom logic

4. **Deploy:**
   - Test locally
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor via health endpoint

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Room Handler Not Loading

- Check folder name matches room name
- Verify `index.js` exists in folder
- Ensure class is exported
- Check for syntax errors in handler

### Messages Not Working

- Check `validateMessage()` returns `null` for valid messages
- Verify `onMessage()` doesn't return `false`
- Ensure no exceptions in handlers

### Clients Rejected

- Check `onJoin()` returns `true` or data (not `false`)
- Verify authentication logic
- Check server logs for errors
