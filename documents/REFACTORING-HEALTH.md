# Health Module Refactoring

## Summary

The health check endpoint has been successfully refactored into a dedicated module at `src/health/`, improving code organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Module Structure

**Created:** `src/health/index.js`

- `generateHealthResponse(rooms, wss, detailed)` - Generates health response object
- `handleHealthRequest(req, res, rooms, wss)` - HTTP request handler
- `isHealthRequest(req)` - Request matcher function

**Created:** `src/health/README.md`

- Complete documentation for the health module
- API examples and usage instructions
- Monitoring guidelines

### 2. Updated Files

**Modified:** `src/server.js`

- Added import: `import { handleHealthRequest, isHealthRequest } from "./health/index.js"`
- Replaced inline health endpoint logic with module calls
- Reduced ~40 lines of code in main server file

### 3. Module Architecture

```
src/
├── health/
│   ├── index.js          # Health check logic
│   └── README.md         # Documentation
├── server.js             # Main server (now cleaner)
└── ...
```

## Benefits

### ✅ **Better Organization**

- Health logic isolated in its own module
- Easier to find and maintain
- Consistent with other modules (auth, rooms, postcontent)

### ✅ **Improved Testability**

- Functions can be tested independently
- Easier to mock dependencies
- Clear function signatures

### ✅ **Cleaner server.js**

- Reduced complexity in main file
- Better separation of concerns
- More readable routing logic

### ✅ **Reusability**

- Health functions can be used elsewhere
- Easy to add additional health endpoints
- Extensible architecture

## API Unchanged

The health endpoint behavior remains **exactly the same**:

```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Detailed health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health?detailed=true
```

## Testing

Server started successfully with refactored health module:

```
✅ AUTH_SECRET loaded from environment
Initializing room handlers...
✓ Registered handler for room: radio
✓ Registered handler for room: chat
Registered 2 room handler(s): [ 'radio', 'chat' ]
WebSocket broadcast server listening (internal port 8080).
Public base: http://localhost:8080
Health endpoint: http://localhost:8080/health ✅
WebSocket URL: ws://localhost:8080
Room handlers ready: radio, chat
```

## Future Enhancements

The modular structure now makes it easy to add:

- `/health/live` - Liveness probe
- `/health/ready` - Readiness probe
- `/health/metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- Custom health checks per room
- Database connection health
- External service health checks

## Migration Notes

- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ No configuration changes required
- ✅ No deployment changes needed
- ✅ Backward compatible
